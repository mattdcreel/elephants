    <p class="about">
        Earth’s largest mammal, the elephant, is also one of its most endangered. Depending on 
        the where the elephants are from, they are generally threatened either by illegal hunting or 
        habitat loss.
        <br><br> 
        Asian elephants are the most endangered variety of the species, primarily because they are 
        threatened by habitat destruction rather than poaching. Development in the Asian world encroaches on 
        the areas elephants call home.

            World Wildlife</a> Foundation estimates that “a large portion of the world’s human population 
            now lives in or near Asian elephant habitat, which has dwindled to just 15% of its historic range.”

<p class="bodytext">
    The largest elephant species, and the largest mammal on earth, African elephants uniquely face a primary threat 
    of poaching. 
    <br><br>
    Countries around the world have been trying to crack down on this illegal activity for decades. 
    In 1973, <a href="https://www.thoughtco.com/poaching-in-africa-43351">80 countries</a>
    signed an international agreement known as the Convention on International Trade in 
    Endangered Species of Wild Flora and Fauna, or CITES. As of June 2021, 
    <a href="https://cites.org/eng/disc/parties/chronolo.php?order=field_official_name&sort=asc">
        183 countries have signed the contract.</a>
    Parties to the CITES agreement have to implement the 
    convention, but it doesn’t supersede national laws. CITES is administered by the United Nations, who 
    monitors compliance and activity related to the agreement. In 1990, most African elephants were added 
    to Appendix I of the which means that participating countries agreed not to allow their trade for 
    commercial purposes *.
    <br> 
    <sub> * With the exception of elephants in Botswana, South Africa, Zimbabwe, and Namibia.</sub>
    <br><br>
The elephant populations in Botswana, South Africa, Zimbabwe, and Namibia were added to Appendix II between 
1990 and 2000. Appendix II permits trade in ivory, which generally happens from stockpiles the countries amassed 
by seizing ivory from traders during the global ban.  
<br><br>
The problem with any legitimate trade in ivory, as allowed by Appendix II, is that you can’t distinguish illegal 
vs legitimate ivory without catching a poacher or a black-market trader in the act. Once it’s sold, all ivory 
looks the same. Without penalties for the ownership of ivory, purchasers can publicly display it, creating 
demand in the market. 
<br><br>
To make matters worse, elephant poaching and ivory smuggling have become 
<a href="https://www.nationalgeographic.com/tracking-ivory/article.html">methods of 
financing for terrorist organizations</a>. Occasionally, stockpiles of ivory have been burned, rather than traded, 
to prevent that ivory from propping up ivory markets. However, that has also been estimated to have increased 
the price of ivory, fueling supply interest as well as demand.  
<br><br>
Asian and African elephants have 
<a href="https://safarisafricana.com/african-vs-asian-elephant/#:~:text=Number%20of%20toenails&text=The%20
number%20of%20toenails%20varies,forest%20elephant%2C%20and%20Asian%20elephant%3A&text=African%20bush%20elephants%
3A%204%20toenails,4%20on%20the%20back%20feet">
several differences</a> in their physical characteristics. African elephants can be distinguished by the shape of their head (single hump vs the 
double hump in Asian elephants) and the size and shape of their ears which, ironically, tend to be shaped like 
the African continent. African elephants are also unique in that both males and females grow tusks.
<br>

<h3>Elephant Trait Differences</h3>
    
<div class="traits">

<div class="asianimg">

        <h1 class="titles"> The Asian Elephant </h1>
    </div>
</div>

<p class="bodytext">
    Only some males grow tusks, which are typically smaller than the tusks found on their African relatives. 
    They are generally smaller in size and weight than African elephants and have ears that are more rounded. 
    Interestingly, African and Asian elephants all have five toes, but have different amounts of toe nails. 

<br><br>
Whereas the African elephant is threatened almost exclusively by human poachers, Asian elephants are threatened 
by humans in a different way. The dynamics of this are well summarized by the 
<a href="https://www.worldwildlife.org/species/asian-elephant">World Wildlife Fund</a>:
<br><br>
<blockquote>“The biggest threat to Asian elephants is habitat loss and fragmentation. Asia is the most populous continent on 
Earth, where development and economic growth have led to encroachment into places where elephants live. This has 
led to an average of 70% of elephants being found outside protected areas today. Expanding human settlements, 
plantations, industry, farming, mining, and linear infrastructure (roads, railway lines, irrigation canals, etc.) 
have squeezed elephant populations into smaller pockets of forest surrounded by human settlements that often 
block traditional migratory routes.” </blockquote>
</p>

<p class="bodytext">

<br>

Human-elephant conflict is also a pervasive problem. As human development encroaches on elephant habitats, 
elephants are found wandering through human populations in search of food and water. Typically, this is a 
problem near agricultural lands, where elephants will dig up crops, causing property damage. Villagers are 
often angry about this and may retaliate against the elephants and, when the elephants defend themselves, 
injury and death are possible consequences for both humans and for elephants. 
<br><br>
Asian elephants are also hunted for their ivory, but the prevalence of this is far less because tusked animals 
are less common among Asian elephants. However, Asian elephant poachers are still able to sell their harvests 
for other products, including elephant skin, tail hair, and, which are used for various purposes, such as 
medicinal use.

    Perhaps it’s easier to understand why conservation is important if we first know why elephants are 
    important to the global ecosystem.

    Poaching patrols, semi-militaristic organizations, have been set up all across Africa to monitor for 
    poaching activity and then hunt down the poachers. In recent years, this male-dominated function has 
    begun training females, as well. 
    <br><br>

    </iframe>

    <br><br>
    Philanthropic organizations 
    around the world are involved in these efforts, providing varied resources from technology to equipment that 
    helps monitor elephant populations and poaching activity.
    <a href="https://www.vulcan.com/Our-Work/Conservation/Countering-Poaching.aspx">
    Vulcan Inc.</a>
     founded by Microsoft co-founder Paul G. Allen, provides software and other technology to monitor wildlife 
     and uses survey methods to estimate population counts. 
    
     <br><br>
    Still other organizations around the globe have created elephant sanctuaries to help preserve the species. 
    However, captive elephants live much shorter lives than their counterparts in the wild, primarily due 
    to health problems that wouldn’t be developed outside of captivity. 
    <br><br>
</p>
<blockquote>
    “In the wild, elephants can live to be about 70 years old. In a survey of 4,500 captive elephants 
    worldwide, among African elephants, zoo-born females live an average of 16.9 years in zoos, while those 
    in the wild make it to 56. Asian elephants, the more endangered of the two species, live 18.9 years in 
    captivity and 41.7 in the wild.”

        Global Sanctuary for Elephants</a>
        </blockquote>

    <br>
<p class="bodytext">
    However, elephants in the wild face horrific threats not seen by captive animals. There is 
    <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/how-zoos-kill-elephants/#:~:text=It%20is%20not
    %20unusual%20for,according%20to%20the%20new%20study">
        some agreement </a>
    that longevity is not the only gauge of quality of life, lending some validity to the mission of elephant 
    sanctuaries. 
    <br><br>

    Solutions for the poaching problem aren’t completely clear, but we know that we need buy-in from nations 
    around the world, like China, to police the poaching and ivory trading industries. In 2018, China took a 
    monumental stance, <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-china-42532017">banning domestic ivory trade</a> 
    and closing hundreds of factories and shops that dealt in 
    ivory. Unfortunately, the Chinese ban does not cover Hong Kong which is part of China, but has significant 
    autonomy to manage its own affairs. This is troubling because Hong Kong is considered to be one of the 
    largest trading hubs for ivory. The territory is reportedly in the process of bringing a total ban within 
    its boundaries, also, but until then, it is a major threat for elephants. 
    <br><br>
    
    Fortunately, the ban in China seems to have 
    <a href="https://www.worldwildlife.org/press-releases/demand-for-elephant-ivory-in-china-drops-
    to-lowest-level-since-national-ban#:~:text=Beijing%2C%20China%20%E2%80%93%20An%20annual%20consumer
    ,half%20of%20pre%2Dban%20levels"> 
    made an impact</a>. “Just 18 percent of consumers surveyed intend 
    to purchase ivory in the future, a significant drop from 43 percent pre-ban.”
    
    <br><br>
    Without the cooperation of the nations that are the main offenders for poaching and trading, the elephant 
    populations will continue to be threatened. In Asia, where human encroachment into habitats is extinguishing 
    Asian elephant populations, the solutions are less about a show of force and more about the economics of 
    progress in those nations.
